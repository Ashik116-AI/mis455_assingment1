        <p>
            Carbon pricing, a market-based mechanism, aims to internalize the social cost of carbon emissions by assigning a monetary value to them. Through taxes or emissions trading systems, such as cap-and-trade, carbon pricing incentivizes businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint. By putting a price on carbon pollution, it encourages investment in cleaner technologies and renewable energy sources while discouraging reliance on fossil fuels. Effective carbon pricing can drive innovation, spur economic growth, and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change. However, its implementation requires careful consideration of equity concerns and measures to prevent carbon leakage, ensuring a fair transition towards a low-carbon future.

        <div class="Paragraph">
            <p>Climate justice advocates for equitable solutions to the impacts of climate change, recognizing that marginalized communities disproportionately bear the burden of environmental degradation despite contributing minimally to it. It emphasizes the rights of vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples, low-income communities, and people of color, who often face the harshest consequences of climate change. Climate justice calls for inclusive policies that prioritize the needs and voices of these communities, ensuring access to resources, adaptation measures, and opportunities for sustainable development. Addressing historical injustices and systemic inequalities is integral to effective climate action, fostering resilience and empowering communities to confront the challenges of a changing climate with dignity and fairness.
